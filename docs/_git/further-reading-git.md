Whatever we have discussed till now are the primary commands that are being used in regular work git vcs.

But that’s not the only thing git is all about. The entire tutorial takes reference of the book named “**Pro Git**”, written by Scott Chacon and Ben Straub and published by Apress. We would like you to go through the entire book once and study the topics again that you are interested in.
