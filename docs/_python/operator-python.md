#### Python Identity Operator

Identity operators are used to compare the objects, not if they are equal, but if they are actually the same object, with the same memory location

Let's solve some basic programming problems,

##### Exercise your way out:

**Q -** Given an integer, n , perform the following conditional actions:

- If n is odd, print `Weird`
- If n  is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5 , print `Not Weird`
- If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20 , print `Weird`
- If n is even and greater than 20 , print `Not Weird`

**Q -** eduAlgo is interested to buy a new plot of land for it's brand new office. If the land has an area greater than 4 Sq. Kms, then the founder is going to buy that plot for the office. Create a program that calculated the area of the plot, provided the following,

- The plot can only be circular,rectangular,square and triangular shape. The user enters the plot category.
- Depending upon the plot category you have to take the required inputs for the area calculation from the user.
- And if the final area is greater than 4 Sq. Kms, then print "Accepted", else print "Not Accepted".

**Q -** Given the marks of a student for five subjects, write a program to check if the student is passed or failed ! Threshold to pass the exam is 35%.
