As a developer, you are encouraged to perform different experiments with the code and for that reasons, the experiment section answers will not be given here directly.

Let's begin !

#### Experiment No - 01

```python
# what will be the output ?
print("Amogh","Himanshi","Himanshu")
```

#### Experiment No - 02

```python
# what will be the output ?
print("eduAlgo")
print("is")
print("Good")
```

#### Experiment No - 03

```python
# what will be the output ?
print("eduAlgo",end=" ")
print("is",end=" ")
print("Good",end=" ")
```

#### Experiment No - 04

```python
# what will be the output ?
print("eduAlgo",end="p")
print("is",end="l")
print("Good",end="a")
```

#### Experiment No - 05

```python
# what will be the output ?
print("eduAlgo",end="p\n")
print("is",end="l\n")
print("Good",end="a\n")
```

**PS** - As you have witnessed above, the **\n** is the newline character that enables the printout in the newline. Whenever the compiler encounter the newline character the rest of the text just moves to a new line..
