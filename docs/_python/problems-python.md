85. Write a Python program to find the type of the progression (arithmetic progression/geometric progression) and the next successive member of a given three successive members of a sequence.

For instance, the sequence 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, . . . is an arithmetic progression with common difference 2. For this problem, we will limit ourselves to arithmetic progression whose common difference is a non-zero integer. On the other hand, a geometric progression (GP) is a sequence of numbers where each term after the first is found by multiplying the previous one by a fixed non-zero number called the common ratio. For example, the sequence 2, 6, 18, 54, . . . is a geometric progression with common ratio 3. For this problem, we will limit ourselves to geometric progression whose common ratio is a non-zero integer.

    ```

87. Write a Python program to find common divisors between two numbers in a given pair.

88. Write a Python program to count the number of carry operations for each of a set of addition problems. According to Wikipedia " In elementary arithmetic, a carry is a digit that is transferred from one column of digits to another column of more significant digits. It is part of the standard algorithm to add numbers together by starting with the rightmost digits and working to the left. For example, when 6 and 7 are added to make 13, the "3" is written to the same column and the "1" is carried to the left".

     For example, given [1, 5, 11, 5] and k = 16, return true since 11 + 5 is 16.

     ```
     Sample Input:
     ([12, 5, 0, 5], 10)
     ([20, 20, 4, 5], 40)
     ([1, -1], 0)
     ([1, 1, 0], 0)
     Sample Output:
     True
     True
     True
     False
     ```

115. Write a Python program to find the longest common prefix string amongst a given array of strings. Return false If there is no common prefix.

     For Example, longest common prefix of "abcdefgh" and "abcefgh" is "abc".

     ```
     Sample Input:
     ["abcdefgh","abcefgh"]
     ["w3r","w3resource"]
     ["Python","PHP", "Perl"]
     ["Python","PHP", "Java"]
     Sample Output:
     abc
     w3r
     P
     ```

116. Write a Python program to reverse only the vowels of a given string. 

     ```
     Sample Input:
     ("w3resource")
     ("Python")
     ("Perl")
     ("USA")
     Sample Output:
     w3resuorce
     Python
     Perl
     ASU
     ```

117. Write a Python program to calculate the maximum profit from selling and buying values of stock. An array of numbers represent the stock prices in chronological order.

     For example, given [8, 10, 7, 5, 7, 15], the function will return 10, since the buying value of the stock is 5 dollars and sell value is 15 dollars.

     ```
     Sample Input:
     ([8, 10, 7, 5, 7, 15])
     ([1, 2, 8, 1])
     ([])
     Sample Output:
     10
     7
     0
     ```

118. Write a Python program to remove all instances of a given value from a given array of integers and find the length of the new array.

     ```
     Sample Input:
     ([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 5], 5)
     ([10,10,10,10,10], 10)
     ([10,10,10,10,10], 20)
     ([], 1)
     Sample Output:
     6
     0
     5
     0
     ```

119. Write a Python program to find the starting and ending position of a given value in a given array of integers, sorted in ascending order. 

     If the target is not found in the array, return [0, 0].

     ```
     Input: [5, 7, 7, 8, 8, 8] target value = 8
     Output: [0, 5]
     Input: [1, 3, 6, 9, 13, 14] target value = 4
     Output: [0, 0]
     ```

120. Write a Python program that accept two strings and test if the letters in the second string are present in the first string.

     ```
     Sample Input:
     ["python", "ypth"]
     ["python", "ypths"]
     ["python", "ypthon"]
     ["123456", "01234"]
     ["123456", "1234"]
     Sample Output:
     True
     False
     True
     False
     True
     ```
